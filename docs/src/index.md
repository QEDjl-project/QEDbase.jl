# QEDbase

Documentation for [QEDbase](https://gitlab.hzdr.de/hernan68/QEDbase.jl). This library provides (more or less) simple implementations of Lorentz vectors, Dirac spinors and Dirac matrices. These are usually used in order to do calculations in particle physics, e.g. they are part of the set of Feynman rules for a given quantum field theory (see [Peskin:1995ev](@cite)).
