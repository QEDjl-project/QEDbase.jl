# root type for models
"""
Abstract base type for all compute model definitions in the context of scattering processes. Every subtype of `AbstractModelDefinition` is associated with a fundamental interaction. 
Therefore, one needs to implement the following soft interface function

```Julia
fundamental_interaction_type(::AbstractModelDefinition)
```
"""
abstract type AbstractModelDefinition end

# broadcast every model as a scalar
Broadcast.broadcastable(model::AbstractModelDefinition) = Ref(model)

"""
    fundamental_interaction_type(models_def::AbstractModelDefinition)

Return the fundamental interaction associated with the passed model definition.
