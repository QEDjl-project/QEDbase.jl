# Changelog

## Version 0.2.0

[diff since 0.1.6](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDbase.jl/compare/release-0.1.6...release-0.2.0)

This release is part of the restructuring processes of QED.jl (see https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QED.jl/issues/35 for details).
It is a breaking release, indicated by the bumped minor version because we don't have a major version for this
yet.

### Breaking changes

This release removes the core functionality and moves it to [`QEDcore.jl`](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDcore.jl).
The purpose of this package is to transform from the toolbox status to the provider of all
common interfaces.

### New features

This version introduces the interfaces used downstream in `QEDcore.jl` and
`QEDprocesses.jl`. Among the interfaces already
present in `QEDbase.jl`, we add

- the process interface from `QEDprocesses.jl`
- the model interface from `QEDprocesses.jl`
- the particle stateful interface
- the phase space point interface
- the differential probability and cross-section interface from `QEDprocesses.jl`

See https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDbase.jl/pull/68 for details.

### Maintenance

Besides the new interfaces, this release contains some maintenance and minor changes and
